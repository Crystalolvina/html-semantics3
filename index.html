        <h1>My Teenage</h1>
        <p>I was ecstatic that the time had come for me to become a teenager on my fifteenth birthday. I would have greater autonomy and responsibility. My ability to write would improve and sharpen. Being a teenager was an exciting experience for me. I nearly disregarded my sister's warning since I was so engrossed in the joys of adolescence. At first, I didn't get it, but eventually I understood what she was saying. Teenage life has as many sweets as it does sour notes, as I (and I believe many others) have come to discover.</p>
